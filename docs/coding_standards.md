# Coding Standards and Best Practices

## Code Quality
- [ ] Type hints throughout (Python)
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Error handling and logging
- [ ] Unit tests for each component
- [ ] Integration tests for major functions
- [ ] Code linting (flake8)
- [ ] Aim for 10/10 rated code by mypy, at least 8/10
- [ ] Code formatting (black)
- [ ] Aim for greater than 75% code coverage by tests, at least 50%.

## Architecture
- [ ] Separation of concerns
- [ ] Dependency injection where appropriate
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Environment-specific settings
- [ ] Multi-use application with CLI and web app

## Security
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Secure file handling
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Proper error messages (no info leakage)
- [ ] Avoid coding issues defined OWASP Top 10
- [ ] Avoid coding issues defined in MITRE Top 25 CWEs
- [ ] User passwords salted and hashed

## Performance
- [ ] Efficient data structures
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Async operations where needed
